An extension for JupyterLab that transforms Markdown cells into rich text-editing cells. The editor for these cells
includes standard formatting options that are capable within Markdown such as bold, italic, and underline, while providing support 
for non-standard Markdown features like syntax highlighting for code blocks and the insertion of math equations.
