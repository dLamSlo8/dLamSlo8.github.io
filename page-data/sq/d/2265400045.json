It introduced me to writing responsive HTML and CSS, using Bootstrap to drop in already-built components, and using jQuery\nprimarily as a shortcut for DOM manipulation.

I learned about the power of open source communities and the importance of asking questions to make development in a large organization more approachable. I learned to work closely alongside a UI/UX designer, whether it be collaboratively conducting user research or bouncing ideas off each other.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"workplace":"Upwork","role":"Freelance Frontend Developer","timeWorked":"June 2020 - November 2020"},"html":"<p>Working as a freelance frontend developer for the past few months has been a solid learning experience, whether it be learning how to structure my front-end projects and manage my time more effectively, or just learning new technologies for the job while improving on current skills. However, despite being relatively successful with the few short-term clients I had, I realized that, as essentially the junior developer I am right now, freelancing even on the side while looking for full-time job opportunities was a mistake. Though I learned a lot, I ultimately didn't have the polished skillset that one gains from working in the industry for years, and it was made increasingly clear after some guidance from freelance communities online. I should have put\nmore focus on personal projects in this time period as a means of growth and doing things that matter personally, and that's where my focus is currently, while seeking full-time opportunities.</p>"}}]}}}
